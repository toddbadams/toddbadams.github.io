<h2 style="display:none;">Beaujolais AOC<span class="region-key">FR-BUR-BEA</span></h2>
<h3>Geography</h3>
<p>East and south of the region the alluvial plan of the River Soane.</p>
<h3>Climate</h3>
<p>moderate continental
<p>Ideally suited for early budding and ripening of Gamay.</p>
<h3>Varieties</h3>
<p><strong>Gamay</strong> Can produce large yields, so granite soil (low in nutrients) limits the yields to concentrate flavours. Gobelet pruning where vines are pruned to spurs around the head, then shoots tied together. Produce fragrant wines with aromas of raspberry and cherry fruit. Rarely more than medium tannin and body. Lightest styles served lightly chilled.</p>
<h3>Classification</h3>
<p>Beaujolais Nouveau_ Specifically made for early drinking, released third Thursday in November.  Only available from Beaujolais AOC and Beaujolais Village AOC wines.</p>
<h2>Beaujolais Villages  AOC <span class="region-key">FR-BUR-BEA-VIL</span></h2>
<h3>Classification</h3>
<p>Thirty-nine villages, village names rarely appear on label, as wines are blended from different villages.</p>
<h2>Beaujolais Crus <span class="region-key">FR-BUR-BEA-CRU</span></h2>
<h3>Classification</h3>
<p>Ten villages, largest are Brouilly, Morgon, Fleurie, Moulin-a-Vent.</p>
<h3>Varieties</h3>
<p><strong>Gamay</strong>  Morgon & Moulin-a-Vent produce the most structured wines.  Brouilly & Fleurie are more perfumed. The concentration of the Crus allows for bottle aging.</p>
<h3>Vinefication</h3>
<p>Many undergo crushed-fruit fermentation and some oak, often large vats. Others use semi-carbonic maceration or a small portion of bunches to give brighter fruit aromas.
