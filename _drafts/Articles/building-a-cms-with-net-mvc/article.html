    This is an introductory article on the process of designing and building a 
        content management system (CMS) using .Net MVC.
</p>
<h2>Some Background</h2>
<p>
    I have written a number of books on topics such as project management and 
        the design of electronic systems for automated homes.  The writing process 
        takes about one year and as soon as it is completed, there is a need for 
        updates and additions.  This time I will take on the challenge of building 
        a modern <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system" target="_blank" class="wikipedia">content management system (CMS)</a>
    using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASP.NET_MVC_Framework" target="_blank" class="wikipedia">ASP.NET MVC Framework</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Writing this book as a series of online articles builds the basis of the 
        content, and allows the reader to provide valuable input in terms of technology
         and varied ideas and strategies.

<h2>The CMS Mission &amp; Stakeholders</h2>
<p>
    Our CMS provides  a means to display content on the Internet for a small to 
        mid-sized company, all of which is available for public view.  The content 
        consists of articles, images, links, and videos, with the possibility of other 
        types of content in the future.  All of the content has a very simple workflow, 
        consisting of creating, editing, and  publishing.  Once published the content 
        must stay stable for SEO purposes, meaning no changing URLs and minimal changes 
        to the content.  The authors and editors of the public view content have very little 
        knowledge of HTML, and therefore the creation of the content must be kept free of 
        semantic markup.
</p>

<p>
    The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_stakeholder" target="_blank" class="wikipedia">project stakeholders</a>
    of the CMS can be divided into five categories:
</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Public User</strong> &mdash; Consumers of the content.</li>
    <li><strong>Content Authors</strong> &mdash; One or more persons who create, edit, and publish the content.</li>
    <li><strong>Front End Developer</strong> &mdash; Person responsible for initial setup and administration of the CMS.  This person is responsible for the look and feel of the website, aka developing a theme, writing the semantic markup, planning the content presentation.</li>
    <li><strong>PlugIn Developer</strong> &mdash; Person who adds functionality to the CMS in the form of plugins.</li>
    <li><strong>Core Developer</strong> &mdash; Person who creates all of the core functionality of the CMS.</li>
</ol>

<p>
    The following figure shows visually how the various project stakeholders interact with 
        the CMS and its top level design.

<h2>Next Steps</h2>
<p>
    The construction of a CMS is complex and requires substantial time and planning.  
        The fastest way to get a product to market is to deliver the bare minimum, then 
        allow customers (users) to determine the direction of the product. In the next 
        article, I ask and answer &ldquo;What is the minimum set of functionality that 
        is required in a modern content management system?&rdquo;  This serves as our 
        minimum product delivery.
