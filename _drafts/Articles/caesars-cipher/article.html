    Ceasar's Cipher (also known as Shift Cipher) is the easiest and most well known cipher in cryptography.
     It uses substitution where each letter in the message is replaced by a letter some fixed number of 
    positions away in the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become 
    C, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.

<h2>The Algorithm</h2>
<p>
    The following algorithm assumes the message has been preconditioned to 
        remove any unwanted characters and covert to uppercase letters.
</p>
<pre>for (i = 0 to Message.length)
    asciiNumber = Message.charCodeAt(i) - 65 + self.Shift;
    Message[i] = String.fromCharCode(absolute(asciiNumber % 26) + 65);
return Message</pre>
