<p>The Internet consists of four functional layers;</p>
    <ul>
        <li>the Network Access Layer,</li>
        <li>the Internetwork Layer,</li>
        <li>the Host-to-Host Transportation Layer,</li>
        <li>and the Process/Application Layer.</li>
    </ul>
<p>Each of these layers has several 
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_protocol" title="wikipedia" target="blank"><em>protocols</em></a>
    which are sets of rules used to communicate on that layer.  The following figure shows each of the four layers,
    and a few of the protocols used on each layer.

<p>When transmitting a message each layer processes the message in turn starting with the 
    Process/Application Layer and ending with the Network Access Layer. When receiving a 
    message it is processed in reverse of transmitting, starting with the Network Access
    Layer and ending with the Process/Application layer.
</p>

<h2>The Network Access Layer</h2>
<p>
    This layer (also known as the link layer) defines how to deliver data between the host and 
    client on the same network. This layer describes the protocols used to describe the local 
    network topology and the interfaces needed to effect transmission of Internet layer 
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datagrams" title="wikipedia" target="blank"><em>datagrams</em></a> (packets) 
    to next-neighbour hosts.
</p>

<h2>The Internetwork Layer</h2>
<p>
    This layer (also known as the internet layer) defines how to route messages across networks.
    It exchanges datagrams across network boundaries, and establishes internetworking, thus the
    name the Internet. This layer defines the addressing and routing structures used for the 
    TCP/IP protocol suite. The primary protocol in this scope is the Internet Protocol, which 
    defines IP addresses. Its function in routing is to transport datagrams to the next IP router 
    that has the connectivity to a network closer to the final data destination.
</p>

<h2>The Host-to-Host Transportation Layer</h2>
<p>
    This layer defines how to provide reliable communication, so that data will not be lost or corrupted
    during the transport from host to client. The transport layer constitutes the networking regime 
    between two network hosts, either on the local network or on remote networks separated by routers. 
    The transport layer provides a uniform networking interface that hides the actual topology (layout) 
    of the underlying network connections. This is where flow-control, error-correction, and connection 
    protocols exist, such as TCP. This layer deals with opening and maintaining connections between 
    Internet hosts.
</p>

<h2>The Process/Application Layer</h2>
<p>
    This layer defines how application requests are sent across the internet, using encryption, compression,
    and ?? etc. This is the scope within which applications create user data and communicate this data to 
    other processes or applications on another or the same host. The communications partners are often 
    called peers. This is where the "higher level" protocols such as SMTP, FTP, SSH, HTTP, etc. operate.
