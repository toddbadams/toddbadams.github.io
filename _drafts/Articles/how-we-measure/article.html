    In this article measurement of data is discussed. In particular the properties of 
                measurement and how these properties comprise a scale of measurement.
</p>

<h2>Definition of Measurement </h2>
<p>
    Let's first start by defining measurement. 
</p>
<blockquote>
    Measurement is the process of empirical objective assignment of numbers to 
                entities, in order to characterise a specific  attribute.<cite>Norman Fenton, Shari 
                Lawrence Pfleeger. (1997). In: Software  metrics: a rigorous and practical 
                approach. Boston, MA, USA: PWS Publishing Co.</cite>
</blockquote>
<p>
    In terms of this definition and our discussion, we define an entity as an object or 
                event and an attribute is defined as a property or feature of the entity. In order 
                to measure we need an object or event, which has a property or feature. Let's look 
                at attributes and how they impact a measurement. 
</p>
<h2>Measurement of Attributes</h2>
<p>
    Because it is the attributes of an entity that are measured,  it follows that each attribute must 
                first be defined in a measureable way.  Further the attribute must be meaningful as a  
                means of describing the entity.
</p>
<p>
    For  example we can say the software has 1000 lines of code. Is this meaningful?  
                Let's look at our two criteria:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Definition</strong> &mdash;  What is a line of code?  
                In order to count the number of lines of code  we first need to define what is 
                included and what is not.  On way to define it is to simply count the  number 
                of carriage returns.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Meaningful</strong> &mdash; Does the  concept of measuring 
                the lines of code really matter in describing a  program?  Does a computer program 
                with  2000 lines have more complexity, time spent, cost, authority, etc. than does a  
                program with only 1000 lines?  In this  case it is not feasible to make statements 
                about the complexity, time spent,  etc. of a program with regards to the lines of code.  
                Therefore the conclusion is the attribute is not a meaningful measure of entity.
</p>
<p>
    Let's look at an example of a meaningful attribute. The weight of rocks. 
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Definition</strong> &mdash;  This can be done in one of several  
                        units, but each describes the same measurement. A lighter rock will 
                        always have  a smaller value than a heavier rock.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Meaningful</strong> &mdash; Is weight meaningful to describe a 
                        rock? Sure, knowing the weight provides insight into the properties of the rock. 
</p>

<h2>Properties of Measurement</h2>
<p>
    It is the attributes of an entity that are measured, but  what are the properties 
                of a measurement. Let's look at four properties.
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Identity</strong> is what defines an entity and makes it recognizable.  
                    For example we are all humans, which defines us separately from other animals 
                     and thus allows humans to be recognized separately from other animals.</li>
    <li><strong>Magnitude</strong> provides a means to categorize an entity as  being 
                    bigger or smaller than another entity.   For example the magnitude of size of 
                    the earth is larger than that of the moon. This property allows entities to 
                    be ordered.</li>
    <li><strong>Equal Intervals</strong> can be found along a scale where the  difference 
                    from one to the next is consistent.   
                    <p>
                        For example the difference between 5 and 6 is the same as between 89 and 90. 
                        An example of non-equal intervals can be found in a rating system as part of 
                        a survey:
                    </p>
        <p><em>Please rate your satisfaction in our product: Excellent, good, fair, poor</em></p>
        <p>
            While the ratings do express magnitude of satisfaction, the  difference 
                        between the ratings is undefined.   Sometimes this can be expressed as a 
                        number, but don't be fooled.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Please rate your satisfaction in our product from 1 to 4  with 4 being the 
                        most satisfied:</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            While the difference in the numbers is the same throughout the scale, the 
                        purpose of this is only for ranking and does not express equal intervals.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Absolute Zero</strong> is present in a scale when the zero value represents 
                    an empty state of measurement.  For  example a height of zero actually means there
                    is no height present. However a  temperature of zero degrees Celsius does not 
                    represent the absence of  temperature, after all it can get colder than zero.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Scales of Measurement</h2>
<p>
    Now that we have an understanding of the properties of measurement, we can define 
                measurement in terms of scales. There are four scales of measurement, each having one or 
                more of the properties of measurement than the prior scale. The table below lists the 
                scales of measurement and the properties associated with each.

    An attribute measurement can be categorized into one of the four scales of measurement.  This is done by
                checking which properties of measurement apply to the attribute. Here are a few examples of 
                properties that can be measured.

<h2>A Method to Determine the Scale of Measurement of Data</h2>
<p>
    The figure below illustrates the decision process involved in determining which scale to use in
                measuring data.
</p>
<figure>
    <img src="/Content/images/articles/how-we-measure/measurement-flowchart.jpg" alt="data measurement flowchart" />
    <figcaption>Data measurement flowchart</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
    We start with our data, and ask are these data quantitative or qualitative?
</p>
<p>
    Qualitative means the data are measurements of category, such as make, model, or rating.  
                Sometimes numbers can be used to categorize, such as ranking from one to ten. Within categorical  
                data we ask: &quot;<em>Can these data be sorted?</em>&quot; Examples of this are rankings.  If  
                the data can be sorted, it is measured with the ordinal scale, if not, then it is measured with 
                the nominal scale.
</p>
<p>
    Quantitative means it has some unit of measure, such as length, weight, time, temperature. 
                Within quantitative data we ask: &quot;<em>Does this unit of measure have an absolute zero?</em>&quot;
                If the  answer is yes, then the data are measured using the Ratio scale, if not, then the data are
                measured using the Interval scale.  Most units of measure have an absolute zero such as weight 
                and length.  However there are a few that do not such as time. After all when was time of zero?
</p>

<h2>Why Do Scales of Measurement Matter</h2>
<p>
    Why do these scales of measurement matter to a programmer? The answer lies in testing.  When a piece
                of code is written is needs to be tested. During that test process, an assertion is made, and it is
                here where the scales come into play. When we test, we are measuring, and we must first understand
                the properties of measurement and how they relate to the data under test.
