<p>
    In the previous article 
        <a href="http://www.toddbadams.co.uk/html-page-as-c-sharp-object">&ldquo;<em>HTML Page as a C# Object</em>&rdquo;</a>
    a C# object was developed to hold the settings of a website page. In this article 
        we discuss creating a domain entity from this object.
</p>
<p>
    A domain entity is an object that is defined by its identity. Sometimes an object 
        can be an entity in one system, but not in another; for example, and address. In 
        an address book system each address needs to be uniquely identified and retrieved 
        from the persistent storage, and therefore, it is an entity. In an invoice system, 
        the address may represent properties in the invoice entity, therefore, the address 
        is not an entity. The upshot of this example is that each object must be carefully 
        designed to determine if it is an entity.
</p>
<p>
    In our CMS, the PageSettings object is indeed an entity and requires an identity to 
        find it in the persistent storage. Rather than changing the properties of each of 
        the entities in our application, I am going to use a 
        <a href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/layerSupertype.html" target="_blank">Layered Supertype Pattern</a>. 
        This will encapsulate all of the domain entity properties and functionality in a 
        single object. All of the objects in this layer (our domain entities) will inherit 
        the newly created object.
</p>
<h2>Test Driven Development</h2>
<p>
    I am going to use a 
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development" target="_blank" class="wikipedia" title="Test-driven development">Test-driven development</a>
    (TDD) to build the CMS application. TDD is about writing the tests prior to the code. 
        In fact it is the tests that drive the design and coding of the application. To 
        start this process, first write down what we know about the new object.
</p>
<p>The new object will be called EntityBase and;</p>
<ol>
    <li>have the means to identify itself,</li>
    <li>needs to be able to check equality between two EntityBase objects,</li>
    <li>will be an abstract object, which is inherited by all entity objects in the 
            application (this is the layered super type design pattern).</li>
</ol>
<p>
    The following tests are written to fully specify the functionality of the object. 
        Note that comments have been removed for brevity, the download has complete code.
</p>
<code data-file="entitybaseunittests.cs" data-caption="Unit tests for EntityBase" />
<p>
    I have initialized each test with three objects; testEntity1, testEntity2, target. 
        TestEntity1 should be equal to target, while testEntity2 should not be equal. The first 
        test EqualsToBaseObjectTest checks if a given object is equal to the base object. The 
        second test EqualsOperatorTest checks if two objects are equal, and the final test 
        NotEqualsOperatorTest checks if two objects are not equal.
</p>
<p>
    Because the EntityBase object is abstract, I create a fake object, called FakeEntityBase, 
        which is concrete. Its purpose is to allow testing of the EntityBase object and does 
        not have any production use. For more information on mocks, stubs, fakes, and dummies 
        see <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html" target="_blank" title="Mocks Aren't Stubs">&ldquo;<em>Mocks Aren't Stubs</em>&rdquo;</a>
    by Martin Fowler.
</p>
<code data-file="fakeentitybaseempty.cs" data-caption="The FakeEntityBase class" />
<p>
    The code below is the EntityBase object stripped of any functionality, instead each of 
        the methods have been coded to substantially fail the written tests.
</p>
<code data-file="entitybasesignature.cs" data-caption="The EntityBase class signature" />
<p class="caption">The EntityBase object</p>
<p>
    When the unit tests are run they fail, and it is at this point, I can start to write 
        the code for each method, testing until each test passes. This is known as the red 
        to green method, as the test results go from red (fail) to green (pass). The code 
        below is EntityBase after it has been fully coded and passes all tests.

<h2>Other Entities and Next Steps</h2>
<p>
    The PageSettings, Person, and Image objects developed in 
        <a href="http://www.toddbadams.co.uk/html-page-as-c-sharp-object">&ldquo;<em>HTML Page as a C# Object</em>&rdquo;</a>
    each inherit the EntityBase object, and are now domain entities.  These entities can 
        be stored in persistent storage. The next step is to create a repository pattern to 
        create, read, update, and delete entities from our persistent storage.
