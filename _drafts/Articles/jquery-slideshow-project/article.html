<p>Developed a jQuery plugin for slideshow animation. This plugin has been designed to work with a custom CMS, allowing for easy implementation on all of their websites. <a target="blank" href="http://www.e3consulting.co.uk/" title="E3 Consutling"><span>View an example site…</span></a></p>
<p>The project needed to be up and running quickly, but have hooks in place to allow for future upgrades.  I created a jQuery plugin with optional parameters passed via data- attributes inside the DOM element.  Currently many are not implemented, but allow the CMS providor a means to add in those parameters as part of the administration section.</p>
<p>The following is a copy of the version 1.0 of the plugin.</p>
