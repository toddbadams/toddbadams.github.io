<h2>Unit Tests</h2>
<p>
    The following code is the unit tests developed for the array based queue.  
                See <a href="http://www.toddbadams.co.uk/quick-unit-testing-in-cpp" title="Quick Unit Testing in c++">Quick Unit Testing in c++</a>
    for an article on how the unit test code was developed.

<h2>The Queue Class</h2>
<p>The following code was developed to meet the unit tests described in <em>QueueUnitTests</em>.</p>

<h2>Algorithm Complexity</h2>
<p>
    The following is a list of methods within the <em>Queue</em> class and their respective
                complexity.
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>void Add(T&amp; element)</strong> &mdash; O(1)</li>
    <li><strong>void Clear()</strong> &mdash; O(1)</li>
    <li><strong>T Dequeue()</strong> &mdash; O(1)</li>
    <li><strong>T Enqueue()</strong> &mdash; O(1)</li>
    <li><strong>T Peek()</strong> &mdash; O(1)</li>
    <li><strong>T* ToArray()</strong> &mdash; O(n)</li>
    <li><strong>void TrimExcess()</strong> &mdash; O(n)</li>
</ul>
