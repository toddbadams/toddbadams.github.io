<p>This article discusses the implementation of an array based linear list as coded in c++.</p>

<h2>Unit Tests</h2> 
<p>
    The following code is the unit tests developed for the array based linear list.  
        See <a href="http://www.toddbadams.co.uk/quick-unit-testing-in-cpp" title="Quick Unit Testing in c++">Quick Unit Testing in c++</a>
    for an article on how the unit test code was developed.  
</p>

<p>
    The big take away from developing the unit tests first is to create the 
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API" title="Application programming interface">API</a>
    for the class to be developed. This is accomplished in the Act section of each unit test.
                By writing the Act section first, an understanding of how the class is to be implemented by 
                the client software is formalized.
</p>
<p>
    The following code snippet is from the <em>ListCanAdd</em> test.  This line of code
                is exactly as the class will be used by the client program.  Once this test is written
                the signature of the array based linear list class can be designed, and finally the code.

<h2>The List Class</h2>
<p>The following code was developed to meet the unit tests described in <em>ListUnitTests</em>.</p>
<pre data-file="List.txt"></pre>

<h2>Algorithm Complexity</h2>
<p>
    The following is a list of methods within the <em>List</em> class and their respective
                complexity.
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>void Add(T&amp; element)</strong> &mdash; O(1)</li>
    <li><strong>void Clear()</strong> &mdash; O(1)</li>
    <li><strong>bool Contains(T&amp; element)</strong> &mdash; O(n)</li>
    <li><strong>int IndexOf(T&amp; element)</strong> &mdash; O(n)</li>
    <li><strong>int LastIndexOf(T&amp; element)</strong> &mdash; O(n)</li>
    <li><strong>void Remove(T&amp; element)</strong> &mdash; O(n)</li>
    <li><strong>void RemoveAll(T&amp; element)</strong> &mdash; O(n)</li>
    <li><strong>T* ToArray()</strong> &mdash; O(n)</li>
    <li><strong>void TrimExcess()</strong> &mdash; O(n)</li>
</ul>
