<p>Why is a particlur grape variety selected? How are these grapes are managed through the growing season? And, how do they become the style of wine that is so familar for it's region? </p>

<h2 style="display:none;">the vineyard</h2>

<h3>Site Selection</h3>
<p>Environmental - The site’s average temperature, rainfall, and sunlight hours, soil fertility, soil drainage</p>
<p>Business - The site’s proximity to utilities, availability of workforce, site accessibility of machinery, and land cost</p>
<p>Grape variety - The site’s climatic conditions must suit the variety, there must be a customer demand, in the EU there are legal restrictions on variety</p>

<h3>Planting and Replanting</h3>
<p>New vineyard - The site must be cleared, test and fertilized to correct deficiencies. Pre-grafted vines planted and protected from animals, irrigation helps establish the vines.  The first yield in the third year.</p>
<p>Existing vineyard - The vines are replaced every 30 to 50 years, older vines have concentrated flavours, but more susceptible to disease.  Max age is balance between quality and profit.  Land left fallow for three years between vine plantings, replanting cycle carefully chosen to minimize out of production time.</p>

<h3>Winter Vine Training</h3>
<p>Head training - The vines relatively little permanent wood, and are spur-pruned or replacement cane-pruned.</p>
<p>Cordon training - The vines have a trunk with one or more permanent horizontal arms (cordons).  spur-pruned.</p>
<p>Spur pruning - short sections of one-year old wood, cut down to two or three buds, distributed along a cordon (cordon training) or around top of trunk(head training)
Replacement cane pruning - longer sections of one-year old wood, eight(8) to twenty (20) buds.  One or two canes retained, tied horizontally along trellis, most often on head-trained vines. Skilled labour required to select and train canes, known as single or double Guyot.</p>

<h3>Summer Vine Training</p>
<p>Involves trimming the canopy to restrict vegetative growth, and leaf stripping to expose sunshine to grapes.</p>

<h3>Managing hazards</h3>
<p>Frost - </p>
<p>Freeze - </p>
<p>Rain - </p>
<p>Hail - </p>
<p>Water stress - </p>
<p>Nutrient deficiency - </p>

<h3>Managing pest and diseases</h3>
<p>Phylloxera - </p>
<p>Animals - </p>
<p>Fungal diseases - </p>
<p>Viruses and bacteria - </p>

<h3>Concentrating grape sugars</h3>
<p>Noble rot - </p>
<p>Drying grapes on the vine - </p>
<p>Drying grapes after picking - </p>
<p>Freezing grapes on the vine - </p>

<h3>Approaches to vineyard Management</h3>
<p>Conventional - </p>
<p>Sustainable - </p>
<p>Organic - </p>
<p>Biodynamic - </p>
