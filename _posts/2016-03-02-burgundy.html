<h3>Chablis Classification</h3>
<p><strong>Petit</strong> and <strong>Chablis</strong> can be austere with green fruit and high acidity.  <strong>Premier Cru</strong> and <strong>Grand Cru</strong> have better aspects, show riper, more concentrated fruit (citrus rather than green apple), have more body, balanced by high acidity. Some producers age or ferment in old oak, providing a rounder texture and subtle flavours.  Others prefer to retain pure fruit flavours with stainless steel or concrete.</p>
