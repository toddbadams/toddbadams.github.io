<p>The region is broken into two major areas for top-quality, the Left Bank, and the Right Bank.</p>


<h3>Moderate Maritime Climate</h3>
<p>The warming ocean current extends the growing season: spring frosts are rare and ripening well into October.  The Atlantic also brings high levels of rainfall and humidity, which can disrupt flowering and fruit set, promote rot and dilute flavours. Vintage variation is an important consideration, top producers reject unhealthy and unripe grapes.</p>

<h3>Regionally Produced Varieties</h3>
<p>Thirteen varieties are permitted, but three black grapes and two white predominate.</p>
