<p>Steep slopes with south-facing aspects, These AOC wines are exclusively Syrah with deep colour, medium to high tannins, black fruit, and sometimes black pepper and floral aromas.</p>
 <!--more-->
 
<p>The valley is narrow and steep, and vineyards are mainly planted close to the river, where the best have south-facing aspect. Much smaller region than Southern Rhône</p>
<h3>Moderate Continental Climate</h3>
<p>Temperatures are noticeably cooler than in the Southern Rhône. The sites are often in lateral valleys which help protect from the cold north winds known as the mistral, which flow down the Rhône from the Massif Central.</p>

      <h3><span class="md-headline">Syrah</span> <small>black</small></h3>
      <p><strong>Syrah</strong> is the only black variety permitted, and is at the northern limit of successful ripening, therefore southern aspect and steep slopes are important. Deep color, medium to high tanning, black fruit, sometimes black pepper and floral aromas. Some winemakers use high portion of new oak, others use older oak or larger barrels.</p>

      <h3><span class="md-headline">Viognier</span> <small>white</small></h3>
      <p><strong>Viognier</strong> is full-bodied white with perfumed aromas of blossom and apricots, flavours of stone fruits. Sometimes blended with Syrah to add aromatic intensity. Very late ripening, so the wines tend to have low acidity and high alcohol. New oak can be used, but can overwhelm the varietal aromas. Some late-harvested off-dry styles.</p>

      <p><strong>Marsanne</strong> and <strong>Roussanne</strong> usually blended together. Marsanne has richness and weight, Roussanne offers acidity and perfumed fruit characteristics. These wines do not have aromatic intensity of Viognier but age with complex hazelnut aromas.</p>
