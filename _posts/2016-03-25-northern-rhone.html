            <strong>Syrah</strong> is the only black variety permitted. At the northern limit of successful ripening, therefore southern aspect and steep slopes are important. Deep color, medium to high tanning, black fruit, sometimes black pepper and floral aromas. Some winemakers use high portion of new oak, others use older oak or larger barrels.

            <strong>Marsanne</strong> and <strong>Roussanne</strong> usually blended together. Marsanne has richness and weight, Roussanne offers acidity and perfumed fruit characteristics. These wines do not have aromatic intensity of Viognier but age with complex hazelnut aromas.

            <strong>Viognier</strong> is full-bodied white with perfumed aromas of blossom and apricots, flavours of stone fruits. Sometimes blended with Syrah to add aromatic intensity. Very late ripening, so the wines tend to have low acidity and high alcohol. New oak can be used, but can overwhelm the varietal aromas. Some late-harvested off-dry styles.
