date: 2016-03-25 ---
<h2>Northern Rhône <span class="region-key">FR-NRH</span></h2>
<h3>Geography</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The valley is narrow and steep, and vineyards are mainly planted close to the river, where the best have south-facing aspect. Much smaller region than Southern Rhône</li>
</ul>
<h3>Climate</h3>
<ul>
    <li>moderate continental</li>
    <li>Temperatures are noticeably cooler than in the Southern Rhône</li>
</ul>
<h3>Varieties</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Syrah the only black variety permitted. At the northern limit of successful ripening, therefore southern aspect and steep slopes are important. Deep color, medium to high tanning, black fruit, sometimes black pepper and floral aromas. Some winemakers use high portion of new oak, others use older oak or larger barrels.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Viognier_</strong> full-bodied white with perfumed aromas of blossom and apricots, flavours of stone fruits. Sometimes blended with Syrah to add aromatic intensity. Very late ripening, so the wines tend to have low acidity and high alcohol. New oak can be used, but can overwhelm the varietal aromas. Some late-harvested off-dry styles.
    </li>
    <strong>Marsanne</strong> and <strong>Roussanne</strong> usually blended together. Marsanne has richness and weight, Roussanne offers acidity and perfumed fruit characteristics. These wines do not have aromatic intensity of Viognier but age with complex hazelnut aromas.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>Côte Rôtie (roasted slope) AOC <span class="region-key">FR-NRH-COT</span></h2>
<h3>Geography</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The most northern appellation, almost entirely steep slopes with southern aspects. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Varieties</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Only red wines are produced, up to 20 percent Viognier can be blended, but in practice only a limited number of wines produced with Viognier in the blend, and then only a small percentage. Deep color, full-bodied, spicy, and the best have aromatic, floral freshness, intense flavors, complexity, and textural elegance.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Condrieu AOC <span class="region-key">FR-NRH-CON</span> </h2>
<h3>Geography</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Just south of Côte Rôtie . Steep, well-exposed, terraced vineyards.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Varieties</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Viognier</strong> a white wine made solely from Viognier, the best from low-yield old vines.</li>
</ul>
# Saint-Joseph AOC <span class="region-key">FR-NRH-SJO</span>
<h3>Varieties</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Syrah</strong> Vast majority of wines produced from Syrah. The best from terraced vineyards, which have intensity and structure similar to Hermitage. Flatter areas on valley floor use carbonic maceration and have lightest body of Northern Rhône, with pepper perfumed aromas.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Hermitage AOC <span class="region-key">FR-NRH-HER</span>  </h2>
<h3>Geography</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Steep south-facing slopes, vary in steepness and aspect, best wines blended from different sites. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Varieties</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Syrah</strong> Fullest bodied of Northern Rhône and ages well for decades. Up to 15 of Marsanne and Roussanne can be fermented with, but rarely done, adds complexity. Marsanne and Roussanne - blended together accounting for 20% of wines.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Crozes Hermitage AOC <span class="region-key">FR-NRH-CRO</span>  </h2>
<h3>Geography</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Mix terrain around the hill of Hermitage.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Varieties</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Syrah</strong> Up to 15 of Marsanne and Roussanne can be fermented with, but rarely done. Quality, style, and price varies depending on location of the vineyard. Lighter wines are from high yielding, flatter vineyards. More concentrated, complex, and tannic wines from steeper slopes. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Cornas AOC <span class="region-key">FR-NRH-COR</span>  </h2>
<h3>Geography</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Southernmost location, and by far the warmest. Sheltered, well-exposed sun-baked south-facing slopes </li>
</ul>
<h3>Varieties</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Syrah</strong> 100% Syrah in Cornas, deep color, full-bodied, style and quality similar to Hermitage</li>
</ul>
