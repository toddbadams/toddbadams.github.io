    <p><strong>Gamay</strong> can produce large yields, so the granite soil (low in nutrients) limits the yields to concentrate flavours. Gobelet pruning where vines are pruned to spurs around the head, then shoots tied together. Lightest styles served lightly chilled.</p>

<h2>Beaujolais Crus AOC</h2>
<p>Ten villages, largest are Brouilly, Morgon, Fleurie, Moulin-a-Vent. Morgon and Moulin-a-Vent produce the most structured wines.  Brouilly and Fleurie are more perfumed. The concentration of the Crus allows for bottle aging.</p>

<p>Many undergo crushed-fruit fermentation and some oak, often large vats. Others use semi-carbonic maceration or a small portion of bunches to give brighter fruit aromas.
